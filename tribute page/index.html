                      <hr>
                      <p>
                        On 19th November, 1917 Kamala Nehru gave birth to a girl child. She was named after her great 
                        grandmother, Indrani, as desired by her grandfather. Indira Gandhi was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru (the first prime minister of India) and Kamala Nehru.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        When Indira was about two years old, her parents joined the Indian Independence Movement with Mohandas K. Gandhi. The Nehru home was often a meeting place for those involved in the independence movement,
                        creating an a typical environment for an only child.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        By 1924, Indira Gandhi developed the ’Charkha’ or spinning wheel. Indira soon
                         acquired a wheel of her own and religiously spun coarse yarn on it. Indira had 
                         also organized a Bal Charkha Sangh where tiny children learnt to spin and weave.
                          In fact, Bal Charkha Sangh was the children’s section of Gandhi Charkha Sangh. 
                          She was about twelve years old when she created the Vanara Sena. Movement for young
                           girls and boys. At the inaugural meeting of the Sena, over a thousand boys 
                           and girls showed up. The elders seemed to laugh at the Sena, but that did not
                            discourage her. The group played a small but notable role in the Indian 
                            Independence Movement. They not only relieved the elders of the routine chores,
                             but also acted as the messengers of important information.

                        Indira Gandhi, was an Indian politician and a central figure of the Indian National Congress. She was the first and, to date, the only female Prime Minister of India. She served as Prime Minister from January 1966 to March 1977 and again from January 1980 until her assassination in October 1984 , 
                        making her the second longest-serving Indian Prime Minister, after her father.

                    <h2>Career</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                      In 1947, Nehru became the newly independent nation’s first prime minister, and 
                      Indira Gandhi agreed to go to New Delhi to serve as his hostess, welcoming 
                      diplomats and world leaders at home and travelling with her father throughout India and abroad. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      She was elected to the prominent 21-member working committee of the Congress Party in 1955 and, four years later, was named its president. Upon Nehru’s death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri became the new prime minister, and Indira took on the role of Minister of Information and Broadcasting. But Shastri’s leadership was short-lived; just two years later he abruptly died and Indira 
                      Gandhi was appointed by Congress Party leaders to be prime minister.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Within a few years Indira Gandhi gained enormous popularity for introducing successful programs that transformed India into a country self-sufficient in food grains—an achievement known as the Green Revolution.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Following the 1972 national elections, Gandhi was accused of misconduct by her 
                      political opponent and, in 1975, was convicted of electoral corruption by the High
                       Court of Allahabad and prohibited from running in another election for six years.
                        Instead of resigning as expected, she responded by declaring a state of emergency
                         on June 25, whereby citizens’ civil liberties were suspended, the press was acutely 
                         censored and the majority of her opposition was detained without trial. Throughout
                          what became referred to as the “Reign of Terror,” thousands of dissidents were 
                          imprisoned without due process. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Anticipating that her former popularity would assure her re-election,
                       Gandhi finally eased the emergency restrictions and called for the next general 
                       election in March 1977. Riled by their limited liberties, however, the people
                        overwhelmingly voted in favour of the Janata Party and Morarji Desai assumed the
                         role of prime minister. Within the next few years, democracy was restored, 
                         but the Janata Party had little success in resolving the nation’s severe poverty
                          crisis. In 1980, Gandhi campaigned under a new party—Congress (I)—and was elected 
                          into her fourth term as prime minister.
